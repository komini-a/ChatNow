Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my first project, a simple chatting application. I made this project to explore how client-server communication works and to apply some of the ideas I learned in class to something more practical.

**How does it work?**

This is a simple chat application where multiple users can connect to a server and send messages to each other in real time. It's my first ever project, so it's not perfect, but Iâ€™m proud of what Iâ€™ve learned while building it.

**Things I learned**

- Setting up and managing a **client-server architecture** using Java Sockets.
- Creating a basic UI with **JavaFX**.
- Organizing and managing a project with **Maven**.
- Handling multiple clients with **threads**.

**Technologies I used**

- **Java**: Main programming language.
- **JavaFX**: For the user interface.
- **Maven**: For managing dependencies and building the project.
